This project involves hosting a static website on AWS S3, ensuring reliable and fast access through Amazon's scalable storage. To further enhance performance and global accessibility, the website is integrated with AWS CloudFront, leveraging its content delivery and caching capabilities. Security is reinforced by implementing an Origin Access Identity (OAI), which restricts direct S3 access and allows only CloudFront to serve the content. All files and configurations are managed through version control in this GitHub repository, ensuring an organized and collaborative workflow. For detailed instructions, refer to the "Host a Website" and "Attach to a CF Distribution" files.
